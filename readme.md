Visitor Counter
A Visitor Counter is a simple web application that allows users to increment or decrement a counter value using buttons. The app typically displays the current counter value on the screen and updates it in real-time as the user interacts with the buttons.

This type of app is commonly used as a learning project for web development beginners who want to practice their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It is also useful for more experienced developers who want to experiment with different front-end frameworks or libraries, such as React or Vue.

A counter app can be expanded in many ways to add more features and functionality, such as:

Setting a minimum and maximum value for the counter
Adding a reset button to set the counter back to zero
Storing the counter value in local storage so that it persists between sessions
Animating the counter value as it changes
Allowing multiple counters to be displayed and interacted with simultaneously
Overall, a counter app is a simple yet effective tool for learning and experimenting with web development concepts and techniques.
